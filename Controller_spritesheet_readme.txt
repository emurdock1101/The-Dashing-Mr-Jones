README: Spritesheets and Controller Suppport. 

Compile with make, and run using ./bin/myGame. 

**Controller Support***

You will see two characters. The character at the top of the screen can be controlled using a game controller.
You can use normal directional movement to move the character around, and use the A, B, X, and Y buttons to change the animation. 

**Spritesheet Support**

The character at the bottom is controlled using normal arrow keys, and works by loading in a spritesheet. 
You can change the animation by pressing "P" and play/pause the animation by pressing "O". 

Some sample spritesheets and associated xml data files can be found in ./resources/spritesheets. 
Spritesheets and xml data files must be created using TexturePacker, as our xml parser depends on the data files being in the format created through this tool.
