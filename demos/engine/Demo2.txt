README: Spritesheets and Controller Suppport.

Compile with make, and run using ./bin/myGame.

**Controller Support**

You can use normal directional movement to move the character around, and use the A, B, X, Y, and the right shoulder button (RB, not RT) to change the animation.

Animations can be paused and restarted by pressing start.

**Spritesheet Support**

Some sample spritesheets and associated xml data files can be found in ./resources/spritesheets.

Spritesheets and xml data files must be created using TexturePacker, as our xml parser depends on the data files being in the format created through this tool.
